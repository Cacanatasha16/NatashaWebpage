<strong>Reading</strong><span style='font-size:30px;'>&#128218;</span>

<p>Because I am a bookworm and a certified nerd. Reading books during my ample of extra times or when I do feel like I need to read has become my favourite since I was young. Starting from malay cliche romance novel to science-fic or any english novel. Paperback or e-book are all welcomed for me to read to increase my knowledge, vocabulary and creativity. Here are the link of books that i had read before and hope others can find it enjoyable to spend their time reading.<a href="file:///C:/Users/user/Documents/movie&book/Book%20and%20Movies%203.htm">Anis's book Recommendation.com</a></p>

<strong>Watching Movies</strong> <span style='font-size:30px;'>&#127871;</span>

<p>Watching movies has been my go to activity every single time since I find it enjoyable and I do like the fact that it help me escape from my reality. <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">Marvels and superhero movies</span>  are my favourite and I would always spend more money to watch it in the cinema and as an early birds, cause who didn't like to brag abo0ut spoilers before everyone else right?.heheheheheehe. Other than, i'm just a typical ordinary girl who watch k-drama series and Netflix series. Ohh apparently, i do like dystopian kind of movies very much. Dystopian movie are thrilling and super good like <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">The Divergent series and the Hunger Games</span>. I love women who can stand on their one and brave enough to break the history.</p>

  <h2> <span style='font-size:50px;'>&#129337;</span> Working Experience <span style='font-size:50px;'>&#129337;</span></h2>
  <p>This are some job that I have done during semester breaks or during weekends</p>
</div>
<p></p>
<em> I love to work during my youth especially as a part timer since i have less commitment except from being a student. I divide my time wisely to ensure that my work wil not disturb my study schedule and only working if i have a free time. For me, working various type of jobs will be beneficial for my resume and working experience and maybe will help me to improve my work life quality in the future. Apart from that, working during studying is great for me as i can build connection and meet new friends along the way while gaining experience. </em>
